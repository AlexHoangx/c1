# Q6: Please describe a database or storage performance issue you had to resolve. What was the business logic, why was there a performance issue and how did you go about resolving it?

From the past, I had a system using SQL Server as the Relational Database(RDBMS). It was used for a website for market and competitors research so it was low writen and heavy risk. We built it as single node and used shared storage due to the budget, so the biggest issue we faced was the short of storage. This issue mostly came from the two reasons for this issue:

1. The first reason is, the physical drive which stores the database, or its transaction log has run out of space. To resolve this, examine that disk for any file(s) that are rapidly growing or any other problems. 
2. The other one is, the database or the transaction log file has a set maximum file size. To resolve the case, simply increase the limit to allow database operation. Other reason could take place when tempdb is full. To fix this we just need to restart the MSSQL service and restarting SQL will recreate tempdb from scratch. After that, it needs to increase maximum size to prevent this happen in the future.
